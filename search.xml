    <content type="text"><![CDATA[今天为大家介绍一款由IBM公司推出的一款手机游戏‘Hello Quantum’。 游戏中你可以操作特定的量子逻辑门来实现量子态的变化。 上图展示了游戏内景，游戏正中间是整个两量子比特系统的状态，左下角和右下角的白色高亮区域表示的是量子比特本身（黑色代表量子比特0，白色代表量子比特1，无色代表它处在0和1的某种叠加状态），较暗区域为量子比特之间的关联特性（黑色代表其所关联的量子比特相同，白色代表不同，无色代表不确定）。左上角为目标状态，我们需要通过系统周围的量子逻辑门将其演化成要求的状态。 如果想深入了解这个游戏，可以访问游戏设计者Dr James Wootton的引导网站https://medium.com/qiskit/hello-quantum-2c1c00fe830chttps://medium.com/qiskit/hello-quantum-2c1c00fe830c或者Hello Quantum官网查阅相关资料 这个游戏设计的精巧，但它并不完全是两量子比特计算系统的仿真，与真实的量子系统有不少出入，如果这个游戏激发起来你对量子计算的兴趣不妨可以试试IBM的5量子比特量子计算机和量子仿真器，设计或验证量子算法，感受未来科技。量子计算一定不会让你失望 下面附上B站的游戏演示视频及链接 https://www.bilibili.com/video/av53837706/]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[阿兰·阿斯佩先生的量子光学课程真是非常有趣，现在Coursera上推出了这一系列课程的第一部分，Quantum Optics 1 : Single Photons。这一部分注重于用基础的量子化方法构筑量子光学体系，是量子光学中非常基础的内容，从单模光量子化到多模量子化，从单光子表征到单光子探测，从波粒二象性到互补原理。课程地址：https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-optics-single-photon/ 以下是它的官方介绍：This course gives you access to basic tools and concepts to understand research articles and books on modern quantum optics. You will learn about quantization of light, formalism to describe quantum states of light without any classical analogue, and observables allowing one to demonstrate typical quantum properties of these states. These tools will be applied to the emblematic case of a one-photon wave packet, which behaves both as a particle and a wave. Wave-particle duality is a great quantum mystery in the words of Richard Feynman. You will be able to fully appreciate real experiments demonstrating wave-particle duality for a single photon, and applications to quantum technologies based on single photon sources, which are now commercially available. The tools presented in this course will be widely used in our second quantum optics course, which will present more advanced topics such as entanglement, interaction of quantized light with matter, squeezed light, etc…So if you have a good knowledge in basic quantum mechanics and classical electromagnetism, but always wanted to know:• how to go from classical electromagnetism to quantized radiation,• how the concept of photon emerges,• how a unified formalism is able to describe apparently contradictory behaviors observed in quantum optics labs,• how creative physicists and engineers have invented totally new technologies based on quantum properties of light,then this course is for you. 附上我的结业证书： 阿斯佩先生的签名一点都看不懂（逃]]></content>
